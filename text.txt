“I think in recent years, our offense has struggled at times to score, but I think we've learned as [a] unit what works and what doesn't going forward.” —Michael Gillow, senior and co-captain.


“We tend to get a bit sloppy in the final third of the field, but I'm confident we can solidify this by the beginning of the season.” —Caleb Smith-Salzburg, senior and co-captain.


Focus Sentence: As school starts up again, the Stuyvesant boys’ soccer team, the Peglegs, prepare for another strong season.


The end of summer means the beginning of a new season for Stuyvesant’s boys’ soccer team, the Peglegs. Each year, boys from all grades attend tryouts in the hopes of earning a spot on the coveted team, which competes in the PSAL Manhattan A1 division. 
At the end of last year’s soccer season, the Peglegs were ranked third in their division, with a record of eight wins to four losses. The team was the 21st seed in the playoffs, and the Peglegs played their first playoff game against the 12th seed, Staten Island Tech (SIT). Unfortunately, their playoff run was ended by a 4-0 loss to SIT. 
Though the team lost six important seniors this year, it still has a strong starting lineup, composed of many returning players alongside some younger faces. “I've played with some of the players for four years now, and I know exactly how to play with them,” senior and co-captain Michael Gillow said.
The team has prioritized specific skills for the coming year. “We need to improve on keeping the ball once we get out of our half and our offense in general. We tend to get a bit sloppy in the final third of the field, but I'm confident we can solidify this by the beginning of the season,” senior and co-captain Caleb Smith-Salzburg said.
Gillow agreed, reflecting on improvements that can be made from prior years and their playing. “I think the most improvement is needed on offense and possession of the ball in particular,” Gillow said. “In recent years, our offense has struggled at times to score, but I think we've learned as [a] unit what works and what doesn't going forward.”
The team’s first game this year is against Julia Richman Education Complex (JREC) on September 10. Last year, the team fared well against JREC, winning both of the season meets. The Peglegs have learned from their weaknesses last year, becoming more comfortable as a team and working toward a better playoff outcome.

Experiences:


“[I drove] for 10 hours to Raybun County, Atlanta to photograph the solar eclipse in its totality. The way the bright blue sky just turned into...darkness [was] breathtaking. It isn't like nighttime—it was something else, like out of a movie. It was almost like the sky and all the light on Earth turned off for a moment. The eclipse has forever changed the way I'll feel about space and nature, and simply knowing that millions of people from across the country were watching and enjoying the same moment in time has been my favorite part of 2017. It felt like everyone could take a moment to forget about everything—politics, work, life—and could just enjoy nature. Just that day, it felt like our country was perhaps the most united it's been for a while.”




“My birthday was celebrated so many times this year because I'm here in Egypt visiting my family. I've had so many people come over and celebrate with me. It's a lot more than I usually do. I usually have a party with my parents, uncle, and sisters, but now, since I'm here in Egypt, it's with cousins, aunts from both sides, and second cousins. It feels good getting this many presents and people remembering my birthday.”


“Exploring the breathtaking Bay Area of California offered an immersive experience that combined the best of a pastoral escape to the country and the electrifying excitement of venturing through a new city. From the Golden Gate Bridge to Lombard Street, my dazzling journeys strung together countless moments [that were] blissful and awe-inspiring alike.”


“I had my first legitimate date-like experience in a long time. I mean, it wasn’t even dating as I figured out, but eh, better than nothing.” 




“I was walking down to the nearest train station when it spontaneously erupted into flames. At which point, I turned around and asked myself why I even bother trying to use the MTA anymore. RIP 145th Street station."

FEATURES [CLOSED] 9-11 anecdotes
﻿Share Your Story: The Legacy of 9/11
By: Anne George and Matteo Wong
686 Words 


Sixteen years ago today, a tragedy struck the United States and had an especially large impact on New York City and Stuyvesant. Since our 9/11 Magazine was published, The Spectator has written countless pieces in commemoration. Today, we want to let your stories do the telling. 


Responses have been condensed and edited for clarity.


“Don't remember where [or] when, but I saw this thing where it said whenever [the clock] hits 9:11, the person would stay silent and contemplate for a moment. That's about as much of a connection you can get from me. I think about it, but I have no strong emotions about it like my mother and father do. Where they are from, Muslims aren't thought of very kindly, to put it nicely. Especially now, when the country is dealing with some problems involving Muslims, it just makes this gap a bit bigger. I have not been raised with suspicion against certain groups and [have not] been so close to a terrorist attack myself, but I do understand one thing: it has changed everything. So, I guess it isn't history, but I can't say I think about it often.” —Anonymous, sophomore


“My dad was a police officer and helped clean up the debris after the attacks. Every year, on 9/11, he reminds me of the many NYPD and FDNY responders who passed away, and it makes me appreciate having my father still with me today.” —William Hong, senior


“I definitely feel like there is a divide between the generation that experienced 9/11 (even if they weren't actually in New York to see it) and the generation that was born in the years afterward. Whenever [I try to] have rational arguments about the Iraq War, my elders are always able to say, ‘Well you weren't there. You didn't know what it was like.’ It's an emotionally charged event, and those who didn't live through [it] lose the ethos to be able to discuss it with those who did.” —Julian Giordano, freshman


“As a Muslim, I believe that it has shaped people's perception of me unfairly. They may not be as kind or may expect something different of me just based on my faith. They may expect me to be aggressive or menacing. They view me as a threat. And, as a Muslim woman, they may expect me to be passive. The problem is with all of this. None of these things are true.” —Fariya Farah, sophomore




“Bush's response [to 9/11] was ill-formed and misdirected and created more hate in and out of the United States. There was absolutely no reason for the United States to attack Iraq; Iraq was a fall-guy for Saudi Arabia, the country from which the terrorists actually came. George W. was settling a personal vendetta between his father and Iraq.”  —Eve Wening, sophomore




“I believe his response was justified. Too little action and the American people would complain of ‘Bush the Pacifist.’ Too much, well, you can never have too much action against a war that truly affects the American people. We achieved great influence over the Middle East, having such a large military presence in Afghanistan and Iraq. Also, it set the platform for the dismantling of ISIL, which is crumbling as we speak.” —Eric Shau, sophomore


“I hear insulting remarks every day when I used to wear the hijab and the jokes revolving around me involved 9/11 and Al Qaeda. I responded with laughter, of course. Now I don't wear it for personal reasons, but some of it is because of those remarks.” —Anonymous, junior


“[If 9/11 had not happened], Trump would not have gotten elected. People have always been scared of the relative unknown, and Trump capitalized on that fear.”  —Meril Mousoom, freshman


“In many ways it united us, even though we don't feel very united at the moment. We also know what terrorists are capable of and want to do. In another way, it created a lot of tension toward the Muslim community that is shaping current political stances.” —Camille Sadoff, sophomore
