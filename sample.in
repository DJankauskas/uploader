Stuyvesant’s Summer of 2017
By Anne George, Matteo Wong, Katie Wu, and Blythe Zadrozny

Summer isn’t a time for winding down for many Stuyvesant students. Instead, it’s filled with numerous activities, ranging from interning with NASA to exploring the Galapagos Islands. We wanted to find out what Stuyvesant students have been up to this summer.

Note: All optional answers have been omitted in correlations. All results reflect the experiences of the responders rather than the entirety of the Stuyvesant population.

Experiences:

“[I drove] for 10 hours to Raybun County, Atlanta to photograph the solar eclipse in its totality. The way the bright blue sky just turned into...darkness [was] breathtaking. It isn't like nighttime—it was something else, like out of a movie. It was almost like the sky and all the light on Earth turned off for a moment. The eclipse has forever changed the way I'll feel about space and nature, and simply knowing that millions of people from across the country were watching and enjoying the same moment in time has been my favorite part of 2017. It felt like everyone could take a moment to forget about everything—politics, work, life—and could just enjoy nature. Just that day, it felt like our country was perhaps the most united it's been for a while.”


“My birthday was celebrated so many times this year because I'm here in Egypt visiting my family. I've had so many people come over and celebrate with me. It's a lot more than I usually do. I usually have a party with my parents, uncle, and sisters, but now, since I'm here in Egypt, it's with cousins, aunts from both sides, and second cousins. It feels good getting this many presents and people remembering my birthday.”

“Exploring the breathtaking Bay Area of California offered an immersive experience that combined the best of a pastoral escape to the country and the electrifying excitement of venturing through a new city. From the Golden Gate Bridge to Lombard Street, my dazzling journeys strung together countless moments [that were] blissful and awe-inspiring alike.”

“I had my first legitimate date-like experience in a long time. I mean, it wasn’t even dating as I figured out, but eh, better than nothing.”


“I was walking down to the nearest train station when it spontaneously erupted into flames. At which point, I turned around and asked myself why I even bother trying to use the MTA anymore. RIP 145th Street station."
