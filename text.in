1. You will love spending an excessive amount of time blankly staring at your article, hoping that some text will magically appear. It cannot be guaranteed, however, that it will be something coherent. You might slip in a “screw you, editor” somewhere in the article.
More likely, though, you will type “uriehfliuwer” after you fall into a deep slumber. If you were writing for the Arts and Entertainment, Opinions, or Sports departments, “uriehfliuwer” would most likely be published.
 
2. You will enjoy seeing your article plastered all over the floor of the bridge. In an ultimate sign of veneration, students will trample over your article. “When I walk all over The Spectator, it becomes the ground I stand on,” senior August Hochman said. 
 

4. You will drastically improve your speed-writing skills. When your editor interrogates you about the status of your article five-and-a-half days after the due date, you will develop a supernatural ability to fabricate a 2000-word article replete with seven interviews in under an hour. Your impressed editor will gladly oblige in rewriting half of the article. 
 
5. You will not have to fret about finding journalistic sources for interviews. Certainly, quotes serve no real purpose; everyone’s intentions can be implied.
